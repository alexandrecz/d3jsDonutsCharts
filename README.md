# d3jsDonutsCharts
Simple sample using ReactJS + D3JS and Vite

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn dev`

Runs the app in the development mode with the speed of the light - I mean speed of the Vite ;-) .<br />

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
